# Big-Data

Assignment 1 - Big Data - Regan Alt
The "Regan Alt Project 5" python notebook in this repository is the fifth assignment for Python Programming for the MSBA program at Fordham University. 
It consists of importing a picture from the internet, downloading 6 months of   trading data for Tesla's stock and checking the attributes. 
Then I had to identify if there are any missing values in the data, rename all the columns names to be in lower case format, scale the trading columes to be in thousands of shares, and find the highest closing price and its date.
Then, I created visual representaitons of the data. First, I constructed a histogram showing the distribution of the Closing Price of the 6-month period, and then  a line graph portraying the Closing Price's trend over time. After, there is a scatter plot displaying the trading volume and closing price concluding there is no clear relationship between the two variables. 
Next, I created a line plot that portrays trading colume over time, and found the number of days where closing price was listed greater than or equal to $400. 
Lastly, I created a new dataframe where the Tesla stock trading vlume was above aver and closing price was above $300, and extracted this data into an excel file.
